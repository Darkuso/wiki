# Tokenomics

Saito has a standalone document with graphics and charts and tables that outlines the network tokenomics. If you're interested in a more detailed look at the network tokenomics we recommend checking out that [that file](https://saito.io/saito-tokenomics.pdf).

## Token Supply

The Saito network is designed for a max coin supply of 10bb. These tokens are divided between ERC20 / BEP20 tokens and on-chain SAITO tokens. The ERC20 tokens are intended for integration with other parts of the cryptocurrencty ecosystem like exchanges and can be withdrawn to on-chain tokens at any time.

There are currently 3bb SAITO tokens in circulation. Additional tokens may be issued in the future via a Community-Controlled Foundation (20%), for on-network use by Strategic Partners (10%), or for distribution via an on-chain Advertising Faucet (10%). 

The advertising faucet is the most unique part of Saito's distribution strategy. It is designed to provide a small flow of tokens to users who are making transactions on the network, such that they receive enough tokens to use the network free-of-charge. Because those tokens are sent back into the network as transaction fees, they will be collected by the nodes and developers who are creating value for the chain. This is essentially a form of mining where users decide which applications and developers are contributing the most value and deserve financing from the network.

The [Saito Roadmap](https://org.saito.tech/saito-roadmap-update/) includes details on when and under what conditions the team will move forward.
