This method has the added benefit of backing up your associated wallets containing other cryptos that you may be connected to your Saito wallet.

**Method 2: Saving your Private key**
1) Click on the hamburger icon on the arcade
2) Click on the “Settings” option
3) On the settings you will see your Private Key as an obscured string of letters and numbers. Copy this key and store it in a safe place.
4) To restore your Wallet using your Private Key just click on the “Import Key” button on the top of the settings page and paste your private key.

**You should always make sure to store your private keys and backup files in secure locations. Wallets are non-custodial, which means only you have control over them; on the flip side there's no password recover, so make sure to take wallet security seriously.**
