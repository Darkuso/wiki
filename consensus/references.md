# External Resources

These resources are the best places to go to learn more about how Saito Consensus works. If you have trouble understanding the mechanism after going through these materials, please feel welcome to join a Saito Community [chat channel](/community) and talk things through.


Awesome Saito
---

[Awesome Saito](https://github.com/0xluminous/awesome-saito) is a community-curated list of the best Saito-related content on the Internet. This is one of the best places to start learning about Saito, not least because it breaks apart content based on the degree of Saito-knowledge required to make sense of it and links to everything from videos that explain the underlying problems to technical documents that outline the solution.

A similar community-run project is [Saito FAQS](https://saitofaqs.com), a site with straightforward questions-and-answers about how and why Saito works the way it does.


Saito Whitepaper
---

The [Saito Whitepaper](https://github.com/SaitoTech/saito-lite-rust/blob/master/docs/saito-whitepaper.pdf) dates back to the summer of 2017. It was created as a practical description of how the network works, so starts with a brief description of the economic problems that affect scaling before moving immediately into a description of how to solve them on a technical level.

The whitepaper is academic in tone, and is best read *after* learning the basics of how the network works. It assumes deep familiarity with both the POW and POS consensus mechanisms. And because it is focused on explaining how to solve the problems on an economic level, it does not simplify the problems in ways that make them easier to see in the real world.

## Intellectual Property

The Saito Team has secured patents in the United States, China and Europe to protect many of the innovations in Saito Consensus and create strong prior art to protect web3 developers globally. We are working towards the creation of a foundation to ensure the open availability of Saito standards for public blockchains. You can check out some of the issued patents below if curious:

- [US patent US10230530B2](https://patents.google.com/patent/US10230530B2/en)
