# Videos

The Saito project and community have put together a number of videos to explain everything from the underlying economic problems that Saito fixes (why the free market can't scale other blockchains) to explanations of how the network works. If you're looking for a 

### Openness not Decentralization (7 mins)
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C81D6B9sgH8

This video explains why the free market cannot scale traditional blockchains without eliminating at least one of the critical "Satoshi Properties" (openness or self-sufficiency). Without Saito, we get networks that look like blockchains but devolve into permissioned networks as they grow.

### Saito for Dummies (60 mins)
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bhKe4NSURrc

Arthur Iwaniszyn has produced a fantastic deep-dive into Saito that starts with the economic problems and how they manifest themselves specifically in other networks like Ethereum. His video goes on to explain how the solution works using intuitive analogies and metaphors. This is a deep dive, but worth it.


### Inception: Fixing the Infura Problem
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fJGuxcEvats

This video uses metaphors and analogies from the film Inception to try and explain why there aren't technical solutions available to us as long as we need to use mining or staking to secure our blockchain. Once we start using the correct form of work (value measurement) all of our problems get solved from the lower-level up.


### Automatic Transaction Rebroadcasting
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=agppUdX9YvI

This is an older video that reviews Saito's circular ledger ("Automatic Transaction Rebroadcasting") and explains how it allows us to scale a blockchain to arbitrary levels of throughput by ensuring the same amount of data falls off the chain as is added to it in equilibrium.
