<h2 class="toc-header" id="tokenomics"> Token Supply</h2>
<p>The Saito network is designed for a max token supply of 10bb. There are currently 3bb SAITO tokens in circulation. These are mostly ERC20 / BEP20 tokens that holders can migrate on-chain as needed and which exist for integration with other parts of the cryptocurrency ecosystem like exchanges.</p>
<p>In the future, additional token supply may be made available to a community-controlled foundation (20%), allocated to fund core software development (10%), earmarked to provide liquidity to strategic partners who bring industrial use-cases to the network (10%), as well as to incentivize consumer usage through an on-chain Advertising Faucet (10%) that will funnel small amounts of SAITO to users while the network builds transaction volume.</p>
<p>The advertising faucet is the most unique part of Saito's distribution strategy. Giving a small flow of tokens to users who make transactions on the network subsidizes usage without allowing users to accumulate significant reserves. Because the advertising faucet will issue tokens in exchange for using the network, it also requires users to actively make fee-paying transactions, the fees in which will be collected by the nodes and devs who are building software and running infrastructure. Saito's tokenomics distribution strategy is thus a form of mining where users decide which applications and devs deserve financing from the network. Tokens that would be distributed to stakers or miners in other mechanisms can thus be spent more efficiently and introduced into circulation without debasing the on-chain economy. Meanwhile, the fee-flow also secures the network.</p>
