<h1 class="toc-header" id="tokenomics"> Tokenomics</h1>
<p>Saito has a standalone document with graphics and charts and tables that outlines the network tokenomics. If you're interested in a more detailed look at the network tokenomics we recommend checking out that <a class="is-external-link" href="https://saito.io/saito-tokenomics.pdf">that file</a>.</p>
<h2 class="toc-header" id="token-supply"> Token Supply</h2>
<p>The Saito network is designed for a max token supply of 10bb. There are currently 3bb SAITO tokens in circulation. These are mostly ERC20 / BEP20 tokens that holders can migrate on-chain as needed and which exist for integration with other parts of the cryptocurrency ecosystem like exchanges.</p>
<p>In the future, additional token supply will be made available to a Community-Controlled Foundation (20%), used to fund core software development (10%), earmarked to provide liquidity for application and infrastructure development should strategic partners emerge who can justify the support (10%), as well as to incentivize usage by bootstrapping an on-chain Advertising Faucet (10%) that will get small amounts of SAITO to users while the network builds transaction volume.</p>
<p>The advertising faucet is the most unique part of Saito's distribution strategy. Giving a small flow of tokens to users who make transactions on the network subsidizes early users without allowing them to accumulate significant savings. Because the advertising faucet will issue tokens in exchange for using the network, it also requires users to actively make fee-paying transactions, the fees in which will be collected by the nodes and developers who are developing software and running infrastructure. Saito's tokenomics distribution strategy is essentially a form of mining where users decide which applications and developers deserve financing from the network. Tokens that would otherwise need to be distributed to stakers or miners can be spent much more efficiently and without debasing the on-chain economy.</p>
<p>The <a class="is-external-link" href="https://org.saito.tech/saito-roadmap-update/">Saito Roadmap</a> includes details on when and under what conditions the team will move forward.</p>
