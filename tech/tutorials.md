# Learn Saito the Easy Way

This tutorial series is designed to get you developing Saito applications quickly, and learn how Saito works as an application platform. Additional tutorials and documentation are forthcoming, questions and comments are always welcome on Telegram or by email.

Our first tutorial takes about five minutes to complete. It explains how to build a simple application that attaches data to transactions and broadcasts them into the network. The tutorials that follow build on this, showing how to listen for transactions, interact with other modules, and more. You can also see how existing modules work by checking out the [modules directory](https://github.com/SaitoTech/saito-lite-rust/tree/master/mods) in our main repository.
