# CSS Guidelines

## General Format

Follow X standard

## Saito Specifices

* Colors should be defined in variables kept in ```saito-variables.css``` 
  *This is to comply with requirements for theme switching*
  
* Files in ```/web/saito/css-imports``` should only contain generic css for the element or structure they define.

* Naming should be consistent throughout ui structures:
```
      saito-hat
        saito-hat-top
          saito-hat-top-band
        saito-hat-brim
```
