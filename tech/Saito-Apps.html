<h1>Saito Applications</h1>
<h2>Saito Arcade</h2>
<p>The <a href="https://saito.io/arcade/">Saito Arcade</a> is an open-source game engine that runs as a fully-distributed peer-to-peer (p2p) blockchain application. All the games you can play run directly in the browser using p2p communications to send and receive game moves. Players interact only with each other - there is no central trusted server for deals or storing game data.</p>
<p>This is one of the first open-source software developed by the Saito team. It has been recognized by the Web3 Foundation as a standard for open cryptographic gaming. &nbsp;Also, the arcade works as a showcase for the games/app/chat/forum / AppStore / etc. These are all applications that run in the browser and send-and-receive on-chain data.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Red Square</h2>
<p>The <a href="https://saito.io/redsquare/">Red Square</a> (RS) is an integration of the gaming apps that you can find in the arcade, with Social media in a layout similar to Twitter. The games/invites created in the RS will be the same displayed or played in the arcade, the same as the chat that is shared between them. For the posts and likes, everything is stored in the blockchain, which means that every single one of them is a blockchain transaction. The Red Square has played a fundamental role in the increase of the transaction volume (as the blockchain security) since it was launched and provides a new way for the Saitozen to interact.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Games</h2>
<p>There is a good amount of games running on the Saito platform now, and more to come that are currently in development, some of them have been made for members of the community. With Saito being an open-source project that is delighted to receive apps from other developers to run them in the network, this is just the tip of the iceberg for what is to come.</p>
<p>The current list of games are:</p>
<h3>Twilight Struggle</h3>
<p>Twilight Struggle is a card-driven strategy game for two players, with its theme taken from the Cold War. One player plays the United States (US), and the other plays the Soviet Union (USSR). Inherits its fundamental systems from the card-driven classics <a href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/620/we-people">We the People</a> and <a href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/234/hannibal-rome-vs-carthage">Hannibal: Rome vs. Carthage</a>. It is a quick-playing, low-complexity game in that tradition. The game map is a world map of the period, whereon players move units and exert influence in attempts to gain allies and control for their superpower. As with GMT's other card-driven games, decision-making is a challenge; how to best use one's cards and units given consistently limited resources?</p>
<p>Twilight Struggle's Event cards add detail and flavor to the game. They cover a vast array of historical happenings, from the Arab-Israeli conflicts of 1948 and 1967, to Vietnam and the U.S. peace movement, to the Cuban Missile Crisis and other such incidents that brought the world to the brink of nuclear annihilation. Subsystems capture the prestige-laden Space Race as well as nuclear tensions, with the possibility of game-ending nuclear war.</p>
<p><strong>NOTE: Twilight Struggle is owned by GMT Games. This module is made available under an open source license provided by GMT Games for usage in open source game engines. Publisher requirements is that at least one player per game has purchased a copy of the game.</strong></p>

<h3>Poker</h3>
<p>Texas Hold'em Poker for the Saito Arcade. Is one of the most popular variants of the card game of poker. Two cards, known as hole cards, are dealt face down to each player, and then five <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Community_card_poker">community cards</a> are dealt face up in three stages. The stages consist of a series of three cards ("the flop"), later an additional single card ("the turn" or "fourth street"), and a final card ("the river" or "fifth street"). Each player seeks the best <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_poker_hands">five card poker hand</a> from any combination of the seven cards; the five community cards and their two hole cards. Players have <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Betting_in_poker">betting</a> options to check, call, raise, or fold. Rounds of betting take place before the flop is dealt and after each subsequent deal.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Red Imperium</h3>
<p>Red Imperium is an open source space-civilization game that uses the base mechanics from the utterly-epic 16-hour boardgame Twilight Imperium. As fans of the original game and its brilliant design, our goal with Red Imperium has been to put something that can help teach newbies how to play, let us practice game strategies and faction rollout, and also just have a fun digital way to get a quick fix between our marathon in-person games. Having a computer automate movement and combat speeds things up to the point the experience is also quite different: a full game can be completed in 2-3 hours and played casually over the course of the day.</p>
