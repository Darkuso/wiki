# How to help

Thera are various ways the community can help in the Saito ecosystem. Here are the things you can do to contribute to the success of the organization:

### **1. Hack up the existing code**

We have a list of random bugs and requests on [Github](https://github.com/orgs/SaitoTech/projects/8). Some are also exploratory features. We welcome anyone to tackle any of these and submit a pull request. You may request for write access to contribute by emailing your github ID to community@saito.io.

### **2. Build a new module or game**

We will help you build that module 

As a starter, we highly recommend you to follow this [tutorial series](/tech/tutorials) designed to accelerate your knowledge in developing a module. You may also use the existing modules in our [Github](https://github.com/SaitoTech/saito-lite-rust/tree/master/mods) as a reference for your development and/or to understand how existing modules work. As you advance on your development, we recommend that you check the various [APIs](/tech/applications) available for your module.

Some general questions that would help you on general matters pertaining to module development, we suggest you go through the following:
1. Is it going to be hosted on your own node or on the existing Saito Node (arcade)?
2. What are the features of the module or application?
3. Which modules from the current [Saito stack](https://github.com/SaitoTech/saito-lite-rust/tree/master/mods) do you want to run on your application?
4. Is it a service, game or utility module?

### **3.	Contribute to more fundamentals research in the blockchain network**

The team have compiled a list of [important tasks](/community/tasks) ranging from researching commutative signatures to proposing ways to implement on-chain scripting or L2 VMs. 

If there is an obvious path forward from your research we will help you write a Saito Implementation Proposal. All members of our team can be reached on Telegram for private discussions of fundamentals and suggestions on approaches or you can email us at community@saito.io.

### 4. **Do you have any idea that can be a community project that needs guidance from the team?**

Whether it's a programming or non-programming task, you may email us at community@saito.tech or message anyone from our team through telegram. Our telegram IDs can be found on the [about section -- Meet the team](https://saito.tech/about/) of the Saito website.
