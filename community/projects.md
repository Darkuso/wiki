# Community Projects

This page provides an overview of community-led projects that could use help from volunteers. If you have the time to help, one of the easiest ways to join the community is finding a project that interests you and helping us improve it. If you have a project you would like to see listed here, please write us at community@saito.io. If you are interested in core theoretical development tasks, we have a page on more [research-oriented work](/community/tasks) we could use help with.
